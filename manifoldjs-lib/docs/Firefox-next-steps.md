# Test - Build - Submit

## Test

1. Your application uses the same rendering and JavaScript Engine as the FireFox Browser so most of you testing can be done on your website and in the browser.

2. To test your application on a device, download the ManifoldJS test harness from the Store, and follow the directions. _Coming soon!_

3. To test locally:

	1. Find the FF manifest in the "firefox" folder and upload to your website.

	2. Adjust the headers of your .webapp file type as seen [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest#Serving_manifests).

	3. Open the developer tools from within the Firefox browser. Open Firefox WebIDE, and select "open hosted app". You will be prompted for the address of your manifest.

	4. Load simulator for FF OS.
