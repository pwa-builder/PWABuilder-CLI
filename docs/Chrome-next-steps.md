#Test - Build - Submit

##Test

1. Your application uses the same rendering and JavaScript Engine as the Chrome Browser so most of you testing can be done on your website and in the browser.
2. To test your application on a device, download the ManifoldJS test harness from the Store, and follow the directions. _Coming soon!_
3. To test locally, open chrome and open the settings. Then open extensions. Check the button that says "developer mode" then select "Load unpacked extension". Navigate to the Chrome folder and load it.
